vagrant4 and vagrant5 are when I first got things working with my own uniform magnetic field.  

vAGRANT 4 USES 4 fold symmetry whiel vagrant5 uses three fold symmetry.

to run opal

opal cyclotron2.in | tee cyclotron2.out

also remember that I put notes on the desktop of my windows machine.  

for gnuplot

gnuplot --persist cyclotron2.gpl

Well shit....I went back to vagrant3 and switched to Carboncycle and it just worked with Lenas field map

for some reason radius 0 has to have a number even if it is small
