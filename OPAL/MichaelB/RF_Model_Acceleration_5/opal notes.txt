The link below tells you how to run their two example calculations
https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src/wikis/Cyclotron


From first link above
"A bash script tuning.sh is shown on the next page, to execute
OPAL-cycl for tune calculations.

tuning.sh./radia-run
To start execution, just run
tuning.sh which uses the input file testcycl.in and the auxiliary
file FIXPO SEO_. The output file is plotdata from which one can plot
the tune diagram."

To really understand this I need to understand Green's Function

I installed docker using on the PI

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-raspberry-pi/

Next
mkdir beamsim
cd beamsim

curl radia.run | bash

after doiing the above once I will just do the below command every time
./radia-run

First time got a "Got Permission Denied" messagechmo

sudo su -

switches to root
it would not let me run it as root.  

I had to type this on a raspberry pi....but then the pi was too slow...
newgrp docker

## This is what Lena does 
in her beamsim file she made a folder called vagrant  she downloaded all the files from the psi example
she types
./radia-run 
    it takes some time...updates docker image then it changes user to py2
	 when you hit ls you get a bin and a src....
	 go up a directory back into vagrant.  then do it again and you get to basically get to a directory for a virtuual linux machine
	   with bin and dev home and all of those normal ole linux things
	   
	   from there vagrant is listed.
	   
	   From there go into vagrant and then when you type ls you are in the directory with radia run.

Now I am installing for Docker for  ubuntu as shown here

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/


First time got a "Got Permission Denied" messagechmo

sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

i followed several tries from this to resolve this
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket

ultimately perhaps not ideal I used 

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
this fixed it.....

Installing docker again on my own computer using the website above

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common


curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -


verify by  typing 

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

now do this....I do not really know what the hell it does...
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

I had to add this onto the commands....

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

then check to see if it worked with this....

sudo docker run hello-world

curl radia.run | bash

after doiing the above once I will just do the below command every time
./radia-run

Then follow lenas instructions above....

and remember for permission denied errors do this.....
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

############################################################################################

So for me to run this as installed right now I 
 1. Navigate to ~beamsim directory
   2.  ./radia-run
      3.  If you get a permission denied error....as I do every time then
          sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
        4.  again type 
            ./radia-run 
            it takes some time...updates docker image then it changes user to py2
	        when you hit ls you get a bin and a src....
	        go up a directory back into vagrant.  then do it again and you get to 
            basically get to a directory for a virtuual linux machine
	        with bin and dev home and all of those normal ole linux things
	   
	        from there vagrant is listed  go into this vagrant directory
	   
	   From there go into vagrant and then when you type ls you are in the directory with radia run.

to Run opal example simply type:
opal cyclotronTune-2.1.in

Then plot it
python3 plotTunes.py

To Run Lenas
opal cyclotron2.in | Tee cyclotron2.out

Running a shell in Ubuntu refer to the file in beamsim called hello shell
it seems in Ubuntu that I must type type
bash helloShell.sh 

another shell problem......a deja vu problem...meaning a similar problem to one I had years before.
it seems perhaps notepad++ saves files in a windows like format so there are end of lines oor somethin
like that 

sudo apt-get install dos2unix

Then,

dos2unix [file]

Full documentation:

man dos2unix

There is a closed orbit finder in OPAL 2.2 and higher...
It is demonstrated the 2nd example from 
https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src/wikis/Cyclotron

says it needs Opal 2.2 or higher and it appears I have OPAL 2.0.1
###########################################################################################

In the accelerated orbit calculation we run the example with:
opal cyclotron2.in | tee cyclotron2.out
tee is just a linux command that tees of the output (like a plumbing tee) so that you can send it to 2 places.  





	  Also if you type opal it should open opal

###  How I tuned in a model with RF               ##########################################
############################################################################################

I first looked at a picture of some orbits that we had got to work to try to get an idea of 
how the magnetic field shape was.....I wanted to know for sure where the particle angle would 
be 0 crossing the X axis or where Y equals 0.  I decided to try starting the model to the left..which is 
180 degrees from originally starting.  Looking back, I do not think this made as big of a difference
as the next step because I think the triangle should always be symmetric about the X axis or when Y
is 0 thus it should have been fine at 0....but oh well

Next I set the RF voltage to 0.  I bumped up the energy to close to 10 MeV then and started the initial 
reference radius at something bigger....I ended up at .4 meters.  I then adjust the energy to make the orbit 
come back to where it started.  For this I only ran a couple of turns for the simulation.   Once I got this to work I 
changed it to 100 turns for the simulation.  I then adjusted the energy of the beam to find the range of 
energies that produced a stable orbit for this specific radius.  

Once I found the range of energies I picked the midpoint between the stable energies.

I then pulled up the file cyclotron2-afterEachTurn.dat.  This file has the time that it takes for each orbit.
I looked at the times for each orbit.  It was about 1.20232790e+02 [ns] though it varied from turn to turn a tad....
I think I could see how it varied to understand phase slippage....at any rate I divide 1 by that to come up with a
more precise RF frequency to set the RF and beam frequency to.  

Now I added RF back into the picture.  I increased the number of turns until it could no longer complete the simulation.
I then tuned on the RF Phase to increase how many turns the beam could make it through.  I kept repeating this process until
I was accelerating.  

Make a method of plotting the energy from the ouput file along with the RF Phase.  We are slipping with respect to the RF
If I get a stable orbit I can accelerate and decelerate several times.  

###################################################################################
I am confused in the file cyclotrn2-trackOrbit.dat
  it is obvious what X and Y are, but beta_x*gamma  and beta_y*gamma are not as obvious to me.

    In the phase space ellipse you can relate this value to x' x and the emittance but ????

    You  can definitely do matching

    how to plot energy....twiss.out???
